A Hashmap is not synchronized, it is not thread-safe, and it allows null keys and multiple null values.
It is also faster than a hash table!
Hashmaps are used in unsychronized or single threaded apps.

Unless you override the equals() and hashCode(), the class won't behave properly. This is because hash based
collections are organized in a sequence where the same hash code determines where objects go and where to find them.

Factory method s allow classes to defer instantiation to subclasses. This design patterns only requires a new
operation as opposed to a new class.

Java garbage collection is how java performs auto memory management. It finds unused objects and deletes them.

An array of data in which many values equal 0. A pretty crap array if you ask me.

List is an interface while Array List is a class. This is an example of Polymorphism, where Array List
inherits List and all its method while adding new functionality.

A comparable in an object that can compare itself with another object. Comparables only have one chance to use
the compare to object. Comparator is an external type and it uses multiple classes.
